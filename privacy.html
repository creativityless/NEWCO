            <h3>These are in detail:</h3>
            <h4>a)    Google Analytics</h4>
                <p>‘T Sum uses the Google Analytics web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google") to analyse the use of the web pages. The information generated by cookies about the use of the website by users will generally be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. ‘T Sum uses Google Analytics exclusively with the extension "ga ('set', 'anonymizeIp', true)" to ensure that IP addresses are processed only as a shortened version and to exclude a direct reference to individuals. Google may disclose data to third parties as long as it is legally required to do so or insofar as third parties process data on behalf of Google. Google will not link the user’s IP address to other Google data.
                    Users can prevent the recording and storage of data by Google Analytics at any time by installing a Google-approved browser plug-in, which can be downloaded from the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=be.
                </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <h4>b)    Universal Analytics</h4>
                <p>‘T Sum uses the universal analytics features provided by Google. With these features, ‘T Sum can record and analyses socio-demographic information about users through a Google ID (if available) and Google-generated advertising cookies (DoubleClick). Where a Google ID is available, the data controller may also collect this data across all devices (e.g. if a user uses both a smartphone and a PC) in order to analyze visitor streams across devices.
                    Users can prevent Google from recording and storing data at any time by installing a browser plug-in published by Google that can be downloaded from the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=be.
                    This website does not use profiling cookies.
                </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <h3>Social media plug-ins</h3>
                <p>This website uses social media plug-ins offered by major social networks (e.g. Facebook and Twitter). When visiting the website, the browsing data can be transmitted directly to the respective social networks, even without the direct interaction of users. Users acknowledge and agree that the operation of social networking plug-ins is managed directly by the company offering the appropriate plug-in. If users use the plug-ins via the website (e.g. log in with their access data to a social network or link their accounts), click on the respective button (such as Facebook “Like” or “Share”) and connect to the server of this social network, which then sends the content of the plug-in directly to the user's browser.
                    ‘T Sum may therefore, in accordance with the terms of use and the privacy policy of the respective social network, receive data relating to users and may add data about users' personal data already collected through their own services. If the user decides to share information with the social networks, they also share data with ‘T Sum about, for example, their preferences. To prevent social networks from collecting the user's personal information, please check the relevant conditions on the social networking website.
                    In particular, the website uses:    
                </p>
            <h4>a)    Facebook</h4>
                <p>This website uses Facebook social plug-ins operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). If users access the ‘T Sum pages via Facebook or vice versa, the user's browser will create a direct link to Facebook servers.
                    If the user is logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to the user’s Facebook account. If the user interacts with the plug-ins, e.g. by clicking on the “Like” button or posting a comment, the respective information is transferred directly from the user's browser to Facebook and stored there. The purpose and scope of the data processing by Facebook, in addition to the respective user rights and settings options for the protection of their privacy, can be found in the Facebook Data Policy (https://www.facebook.com/policy.php).
                </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <h4>b)      Google Remarketing and Retargeting</h4>
                <p>‘T Sum uses the Google Analytics advertising features. These allow users who have already visited the site and have shown an interest in certain products to be addressed via targeted advertising on the websites of Google partner networks. Advertising is indicated by the use of cookies that analyse user behaviour during a visit to the website and send targeted product recommendations and advertising based on users' interests.
                    Users can block Google Remarketing and disable Google's use of cookies for these purposes by accessing the DoubleClick opt-out page. Alternatively, users may disable the use of cookies by third parties by accessing the deactivation page of the Network Advertising Initiative.
                    Google also offers users the ability to manage their own cookies for advertising parameters: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB
                </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <h4>c)     Facebook Remarketing and Retargeting</h4>
                <p>‘T Sum uses remarketing technology for advertising on Facebook. With this technology, users who have already visited the website and are interested in a product or service are addressed by targeted advertising on Facebook in the form of displayed ads. Advertising is realized through the use of cookies via the service provider AdRoll (AdRoll EMEA, Level 6; 1, Burlington Plaza, Burlington Road, Dublin 4, Ireland).
                    Users can disable targeted advertising via Facebook remarketing technology by disabling the use of third-party cookies on the Facebook Advertising Initiative deactivation page at the following link: http://optout.networkadvertising.org/
                    This web site does not use profiling cookies.
