The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. On behalf of the website provider Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website provider. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser.

        <h3>Social Media Plugins</h3>
            <p>‘T Sum uses on its website Social Media Plug-Ins (“plugins”) of the social media networks Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram</p>
        <h4></h4>
        <h3>Facebook</h3>
            <p>The ‘T Sum website uses social plugins (“plugins”) of the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). These plugins are marked with a Facebook logo.
                    If the customer accesses an ‘T Sum website that contains such a plugin, the customer’s browser will establish a direct connection to the Facebook servers. Facebook transmits the contents of the plugin directly to the customer’s browser where it is integrated into the website.
                    The plugin integration provides Facebook with the information that the customer has accessed the corresponding page of the ‘T Sum website. If the customer is logged into Facebook, Facebook can assign the customer’s visit to the customer’s Facebook account.
                    If the customer interacts with the plugins, for example by using the “Like” button or leaving a comment, the browser transmits the corresponding information directly to Facebook where it is saved. The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook as well as related rights and settings available to customers to protect their privacy can be found in the Facebook privacy policies.
                    If the customer does not want Facebook to collect data in the aforementioned way, the customer must log out of his/her Facebook account before visiting the ‘T Sum website.
            </p>
        <h4></h4>
        <h3>Pinterest</h3>
            <p>‘T Sum also uses the “Pin It” button of the social media network “Pinterest”, which is operated by the Pinterest, Inc., 808 Brannan St, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA (hereinafter “Pinterest” called).
                    By including the “Pin it” button Pinterest receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding page of our website. If you are logged on Pinterest, Pinterest can additionally assign your visit to your Pinterest account.
                    The data sent by clicking the “Pin it” buttons will be saved by Pinterest. If you want to prevent this you have to log out from your Pinterest account before clicking on the “Pin it” button.
                    Information upon the purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of that data through Pinterest as well as your options and rights in this respect and settings options for protecting your privacy can be retrieved from Pinterests privacy policy at http://pinterest.com/about/privacy/.
